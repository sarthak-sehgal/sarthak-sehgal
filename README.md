Hi, I am Sarthak ðŸ‘‹ I am a software engineer pursuing Computer Science and Economics at BITS Pilani, India. I love solving problems with JavaScript and C++ and creating tools for other developers. Most recently, I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at Bloomberg where I developed a full-stack analytics dashboard using React, Redux, Django, PostgreSQL and Python microservices to monitor the health of the systems and services at [Bloomberg](https://techatbloomberg.com).

- **Internships:** Software Engineering Intern at [Bloomberg](https://techatbloomberg.com) in Summer 2020. Software Engineering Intern at [Postman](https://getpostman.com) last year where I built specialised DevTools for Postman.
- **Open source and open science:** I am actively contributing to the [Open Bioinformatics Foundation](https://open-bio.org) primarly through [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) for the past two years (student, mentor and now org admin). I am currently leading the [Software Citation Project](https://github.com/sarthak-sehgal/software-citation) which aims to enable research software engineers to add citability in open source software without hassle.
- **Others:** [eLife Innovation Leaders 2020](https://elifesciences.org/labs/fdcb6588/innovation-leaders-2020-introducing-the-cohort), [Awarded complete fellowship of over 1500 pounds to attend eLife Innovation Sprint 2019 held at Cambridge, UK](https://sprint.elifesciences.org/)
