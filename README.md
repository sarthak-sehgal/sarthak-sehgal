Hi, I am Sarthak. I am a software engineer pursuing Computer Science and Economics at BITS Pilani, India. I love solving problems with JavaScript and C++ and creating tools for other developers. Always up for a cup of coffee!

I am currently working as a Software Engineering Intern at Bloomberg where I am developing a full-stack analytics dashboard using React, Redux, Django, PostgreSQL and Python microservices to monitor the health of the systems and services at [Bloomberg](https://techatbloomberg.com). I was a Software Engineering Intern at [Postman](https://getpostman.com) last year where I built specialised DevTools for Postman. I love open source and I am actively contributing to the [Open Bioinformatics Foundation](https://open-bio.org) primarly through [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) for the past two years.

Apart from professional work, I like to spend my time -

* Solving algorithmic problems at CodeForces, CodeChef and LeetCode
* Building applications using JavaScript
* Working out
* Reading (non-fiction, philosophy and self-help)
* Learning about scalable software and distributed systems
